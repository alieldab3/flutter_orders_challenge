# Flutter Orders Challenge
 
This repository represents a simple cross-platform flutter app that displays insights from an API response containing a list of all orders that users purchased from an ecommerce shop.

The app is responsive for different screen sizes and adaptive to Android and Web.

For simplicity, The app was tested on a local json file that contains 100 different order details, found here:

The app contains 2 screens as follows:
- First one showing numeric metrics about the orders: total count, average price of all orders and number of orders returns.
- Second one showing a graph that represents the number of successful orders per each month.
